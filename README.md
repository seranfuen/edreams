Dream diary winforms application

I created this application in 2012.

I decided to use this as an exercise of how to refactor legacy code to make it unit testable and follow SOLID principles.

One great thing about pet projects such as this one is that, unlike what you write at work, I'm free to show it to everyone and to follow up on how my views on programming evolve.

Honestly, as I read once, any programmer who thinks that code he or she wrote 2-3 years ago should stay the way it was has a serious career development problem - if you are really interested in this trade, you always absorb new things both from experience and from what you read or others share with you.

Without changing the structure (this is a too simple an application to bother doing something more sophisticated, or even migrating to WPF) I want to make this application fully unit testable and easy to change and modify.

I stopped writing down my dreams after some bug popped up, and I didn't have the time to fix it - all because of the lack of unit tests. Incidentally I wrote down my dreams non-stop from 2009 up to around 2015, I must still have the file somewhere.

And I'm also making the application more user friendly. For example, I was calling it a "dream database" and using computer-science terms all over the place - and this is a tendency I've seen in real life projects too. Programmers tend to push their concepts to users, when it should be the other way around.
